# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN
This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at predicting plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify various diseases affecting different types of plants.

# Repository Structure
main.py: This script is the main entry point of the project. It likely includes the code to load the trained model and make predictions on new images of plant leaves. It might also include data preprocessing and visualization code.
Plant_Disease_Prediction_using_CNN.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow of the project. It includes:
Data loading and preprocessing
CNN model architecture
Training and validation process
Performance evaluation
Prediction examples
class_indices.json: This JSON file contains the mapping of class indices to their respective plant disease names. This is essential for interpreting the model's output predictions.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Efficient handling and preprocessing of plant leaf images.
CNN Model: A Convolutional Neural Network designed for high accuracy in disease detection.
Training and Validation: Detailed steps for training the model and validating its performance.
Prediction: Code to make predictions on new images and interpret the results.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing the data, model architecture, and prediction results.

# Explore the Jupyter Notebook:
